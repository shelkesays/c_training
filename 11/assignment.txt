1. Convert the program to While loop.
2. Initialize i = 0 and test what is the result. Do you have to adjust condition to check for argc?


Extra Credit:
1. Figure out what kind of code you can put into the parts of the loop.
2. Is there any other way to improve switch case?
3. Instead of switch case use if-elseif ladder.
