1. Try to break code by playing with array and string length.
2. Get rid of initializers that set up name.
3. Accidentally set name[3] = 'A'; so that there is not terminator.
4. Ser the initializer to {'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'}; so that there are too many 'a' characters and no space for the '\0' terminator.
5. Try to come up with other ways to break this.
