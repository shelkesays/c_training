1. Modify the program to ignore filename from arguments.
2. Check all the functions provided by ctype.h header file.
3. Write a program / modify this program to include all / few of the functions from ctype.h.
4. Modify ex12.c, to ignore alphabates and blank, it should consider only numbers and special characters.


Extra Credit:
1. Rewrite ex12.c, by reducing the number of functions. can_print_it(), do you really need this function?
2. Have print_arguments function, figure out how long each arguments string is by using strlen function, and then pass that length to print_letters function. Rewrite print_letters function so that it only processes this fixed length and does not rely on the '\0' terminator. (you will have to use string.h)
3. Check all the functions present inside string.h, and try to use multiple of them in a program.
4. Use man to look for information on isalpha and isblank.
5. Go read about how other people like to format their functions. Check what is K&R syntax and what are it's pros and cons. Try to use any one or multiple of these formats in ex12.c.
